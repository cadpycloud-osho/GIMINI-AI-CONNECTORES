HMACWith:

HMACWith(secret: Binary, content: Binary, @Since(version = "2.2.0") algorithm: String = "HmacSHA1"): String

HMACWith(secret: Binary, content: Binary, @Since(version = "2.2.0") algorithm: String = "HmacSHA1"): String
Computes an HMAC hash (with a secret cryptographic key) on input content, then transforms the result into a lowercase, hexadecimal string.
