flatMap:

flatMap<T, R>(@StreamCapable items: Array<T>, mapper: (item: T, index: Number) -> Array<R>): Array<R>

Iterates over each item in an array and flattens the results.

Instead of returning an array of arrays (as map does when you iterate over the values within an input like [ [1,2], [3,4] ]), flatMap returns a flattened array that looks like this: [1, 2, 3, 4]. flatMap is similar to flatten, but flatten only acts on the values of the arrays, while flatMap can act on values and indices of items in the array.
