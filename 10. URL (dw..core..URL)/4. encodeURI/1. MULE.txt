encodeURI:

encodeURI(text: String): String

encodeURI(text: String): String
Encodes a URI with UTF-8 escape sequences.

Applies up to four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters. The function assumes that the URI is a complete URI, so it does not encode reserved characters that have special meaning.

The function does not encode these characters with UTF-8 escape sequences:
