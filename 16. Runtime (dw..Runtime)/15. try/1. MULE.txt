try:

try<T>(delegate: () -> T): TryResult<T>

try<T>(delegate: () -> T): TryResult<T>
Evaluates the delegate function and returns an object with success: true and result if the delegate function succeeds, or an object with success: false and error if the delegate function throws an exception.

The orElseTry and orElse functions will also continue processing if the try function fails. See the orElseTry and orElse documentation for more complete examples of handling failing try function expressions.

Note: Instead of using the orElseTry and orElse functions, based on the output of the try function, you can add conditional logic to execute when the result is success: true or success: false.

Output
When randomNumber fails, the output is:

{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "kind": "UserException",
    "message": "This function is failing",
    "location": "Unknown location",
    "stack": [
      "fail (anonymous:0:0)",
      "myFunction (anonymous:1:114)",
      "main (anonymous:1:179)"
    ]
  }
}


When randomNumber succeeds, the output is:

{
  "success": true,
  "result": "OK"
}
